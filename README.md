# The Surfly Tutorial 



### Welcome to Surfly 
Surfly's co-browsing technology enables you to share your browser with others. You can start a Surfly session by entering the url of the website you want to browse into the 'start session' panel on your admin page and then invite people to join you by sharing the session url with them. This is the easiest and quickest way to co-browse and doesn't require any configuration. 

However, if you wish to use Surfly as a feature on your own website, you can also add a Surfly button to your website. Simply adding this button already allows you to start co-browsing, and Surfly works without any alterations. If required, small additions to the code allow you to fully customise your session and to use as much, or as little, of Surfly's functionality within your own product. 

### The Tutorial

If you are thinking about using Surfly, or are a new user, follow our step by step guide as we integrate Surfly into our example application. The major steps and changes are illustrated by an image/gif and, for each modification, you can refer to our repository, where you'll find a corresponding commit.
In this post, we decided to highlight the main features on offer and show you how you can make Surfly as visible or invisible as you wish depending on your needs and preferences.

For further reference, please see [the repository](https://github.com/MathildeJ/Cake_shop_example) containing the code for our example website and the commits made during integration. 

**please note** if you wish to integrate Surfly, you need to give Surfly access to the server. This is especially important when you are developing locally.
