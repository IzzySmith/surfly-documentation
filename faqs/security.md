#Security

###Does Surfly use secure connections?
Yes, all connections to Surfly are secured using HTTPS.

###Do you store any session data?
No. All session data only lives within memory during the time of the session. We do not store any session data on disk.

###Are you PCI compliant?
Yes, not only do we use HTTPS connections everywhere, but we also never store your creditcard as this is all handled by Stripe.

###Can I host Surfly on-premise?
For larger deployment we do offer this kind of functionality, contact us if this is in your interest.
