###Is the FREE version really free?
Yes, the free version is really free. But the number of cobrowsing sessions you can start is a limited to 5 per month.

###Do I need a credit card for the FREE version?
No, for the Free version you don’t need to have a credit-card. Also, for bigger clients we offer the option to pay by wire transfer through invoice.

###What happens after the 14 day trial?
After the 14 day trial of the Pro and Business version your credit card will be charged for the first month, starting at that date. During the 14 day trial period you can cancel your subscription at any moment and your credit card will not be charged after the first 14 days.

###Can I pay by invoice?
For enterprise clients or clients with more than 10 business seats we do offer the option to pay by invoice and wire-transfer. Please contact us for more information.
Can I upgrade or downgrade my subscription?
Yes, you can change your subscription at any moment. An upgrade will be effective immediately. A downgrade will be effective at the end of the current contract period (month or year).

###Are the prices subject to VAT or sales tax?
That depends on your location.
Non-EU: For all customers outside the European Union, we do not have to add VAT.
EU: For companies in the European Union that have a valid VAT tax ID, we do not have to add VAT. For private individuals or organisations without a valid VAT tax ID within the EU, we have to add your country’s local VAT percentage.
The Netherlands: Surfly is based in the Netherlands so we have to add 21% VAT to customers (companies and individuals) based in the Netherlands.

###Can I cancel my subscription?
Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any moment. The subscription will remain active until the end of the current contract period (month or year). Alternatively, you can also downgrade to the Free Version.

###What is a seat?
Surfly’s license is user based, this means that while any seat can create an unlimited number of sessions each seat is to be used by a single user. Sharing a single seat over multiple users is not allowed.
