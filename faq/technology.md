###Which browsers are supported?
Cobrowsing with Surfly will work on all modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer 10+, Opera. It will also work on mobile Android devices using the Chrome browser and on Apple iOS devices Surfly supports Safari.
Surflyâ€™s videochat uses WebRTC and will run on Chrome, Firefox and Opera without the need to install any software. On other browsers a plugin can be installed the first time videochat is started.

###Why is Surfly so fast?
We make use of an advanced content-rewriting proxy which allows us to send over the real HTML content from our high performance network. This is in contrast with for example a pure Javascript approach which relies on the upstream of all participants to send over the data.

###How does Surfly differ from screensharing?
A few things differentiate us from screensharing:
1. We do not require any software to be installed
2. We send over the real content without any loss of quality
3. We can enable high performance video synchronization
